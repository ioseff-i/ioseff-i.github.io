Module aims
======

Students will be introduced to the key discrete mathematics concepts that are the foundation of computer science. Seven topics are covered as follows: i) counting (combinatorics), ii) discrete probability, iii) graphs, iv) propositional and predicate logic, v) proofs and sets, vi) relations on sets, and vii) relations on a single set. After studying the module, students will be able to apply the learnt concepts, theories and formulae in real-world examples of computational problems.
