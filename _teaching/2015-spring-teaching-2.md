Module aims
===

Students begin to program key data structures such as stacks, queues, trees and graphs. They are introduced to the idea of complexity of an algorithm, and how to characterise time and space through formal notations and proof techniques. Students are taught using an object oriented language like Java, and learn the basics of test driven development for testing their code and demonstrating its successful running. Students are also introduced to several algorithm design paradigms such as greedy algorithms.
