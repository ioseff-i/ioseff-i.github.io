Set Theory is a fundamental branch of mathematics that studies collections of objects, called *sets*.  
It provides a universal language for describing and reasoning about mathematical structures, from numbers and functions to spaces and relations.

Headings are cool

### What is a Set?

A **set** is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as a single entity.  
For example:
\[
A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}
\]
Here, the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are called *elements* or *members* of the set \(A\).

### Notation and Membership

We use the symbol **âˆˆ** to denote membership.  
If an element `x` belongs to a set `A`, we write:
\[
x \in A
\]
If it does not belong, we write:
\[
x \notin A
\]

You can have many headings

### Subsets

A set \(A\) is a **subset** of another set \(B\) if every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\).  
We write:
\[
A \subseteq B
\]
For instance, \(\{1,2\} \subseteq \{1,2,3\}\).

### Universal Set and Empty Set

The **universal set** \(U\) contains all objects under consideration in a particular context.  
The **empty set**, denoted by \(\emptyset\), contains no elements.

Aren't headings cool?

### Set Operations

Some common operations on sets include:

- **Union:** \(A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}\)
- **Intersection:** \(A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}\)
- **Difference:** \(A - B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}\)
- **Complement:** \(A' = \{x : x \notin A\}\)

These operations follow laws similar to arithmetic, like commutativity and distributivity.

### Why Set Theory Matters

Set theory forms the **foundation of modern mathematics**.  
It provides a formal framework for defining numbers, functions, relations, and even entire branches of mathematics like topology and analysis.
